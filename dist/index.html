                     When was the last time you had asked your friends how they were really doing? When was the last time you had made an effort to genuinely connect with them? Have you ever tried to lift the veil on their smiles and look beneath the happy facade any of them might be wearing?
                     Depression is a mental illness characterized by chronic agony and loss of interest. It affects how you feel, think, and behave and can lead to a number of mental and physical difficulties. It is also known as major depressive disorder or clinical depression. When you experience depression you may have difficulty performing routine daily chores, and you may feel as though life is an isolating experience that is not worth living.
                     depression is serious, and while not always quite manifest, it might be there slowly but surely crushing a soul or shattering a heart. It is not fleeting sadness or transient tiredness. Depression is real. Watch out for your friends. No one appreciates the ‘too lates’.

                     <p>Depression does not always manifest itself in the manner that it should. Prolonged melancholy, a lack of optimism, or a loss of interest in previously cherished activities are the most often stated symptoms on mental health websites and in antidepressant advertisements, and they may undoubtedly be the most debilitating. However, the disorder can manifest itself in stranger ways than we'd like, making it more subtle and difficult to identify. </p>

                     Even though most depression cases do need professional help, there are many things you can do to navigate away and mitigate the pain of your depressed loved ones. It is really important that you take their condition seriously and not belittle their situation or emotional experiences. Always listen to them and communicate how much you love them and they mean to you. And while you should not act as an expert when you are not, being patient and there for those who need you and constantly encouraging them to get help will definitely assist in many cases.

                     <p>If you are experiencing depression, it is really important to take the initiative to heal yourself. When you experience moments of agony and begin losing hold of yourself, remember that you are worthy and loved. It is okay to not feel good all the time, but it is also important to take care of yourself and not be scared to seek any kind of help should you need it.</p>
